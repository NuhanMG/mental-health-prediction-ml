# 🧠 Mental Health Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting mental health problems using machine learning models trained on real-world workplace survey data. It is inspired by and slightly improves upon a previously conducted research project. The related research paper and the dataset used for this project are also included in this repository.

## 📌 Project Overview

Mental health is a growing concern, especially in professional environments. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning pipeline that can identify individuals at risk of mental health issues based on survey responses. By leveraging data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models, this project aims to make meaningful predictions that could support early intervention strategies.

## 📁 What's Inside

* `ml1_hnd241_a_13.ipynb`: A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook containing not just code, but detailed theoretical explanations of all preprocessing steps, techniques used, and machine learning concepts applied throughout the project.
* `Mental Health Problems Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques.pdf`: The original research paper this project builds upon.
* `MH1.csv`: The survey dataset used for model training and evaluation.

## ⚙️ Key Features

* Extensive data cleaning (e.g., standardizing 40+ gender entries, removing date-format errors from numeric columns)
* Feature encoding and scaling using Scikit-learn pipelines
* Implementation of multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
* Model evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix
* Interpretability-focused design and theory-backed implementation

## 📊 Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NuhanMG/mental-health-prediction.git
   ```
2. Open the `ml1_hnd241_a_13.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
3. Run all cells to reproduce the full analysis, or review the theoretical explanations alongside the code.
